==========

NOTE: This repo originally used NASA's FTP to download NLDAS-2 forcing data. [NASA recently stopped FTP support](https://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/alerts/access-to-ges-disc-data-will-require-all-users-to-be-registered-with-the-earthdata-login-system) so the download script no longer works, and the code is therefore removed to avoid confusion.

The author created a new repo that uses NASA recommended HTTPS method to download data.
Intereted users please visit the [NLDAS-forcing](https://github.com/shiyuning/NLDAS-forcing) repository.
